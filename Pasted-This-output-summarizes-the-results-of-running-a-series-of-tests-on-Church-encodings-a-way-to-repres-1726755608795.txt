This output summarizes the results of running a series of tests on Church encodings (a way to represent data and operators in the lambda calculus). Several tests failed, and the details for each failure are provided below.

Test Failures
Church numerals

Expected Result: The numeric equivalent of Church numeral 1 should be 1.
Received Result: The result was 0 instead.
Location in code: tests/churchEncodings.test.ts:21:45
expect(toNumber(interpret(numeral(1)))).toBe(1);
Church addition

Expected Result: The sum of Church numerals 2 and 3 should be 5.
Received Result: The result was 0 instead.
Location in code: tests/churchEncodings.test.ts:28:30
expect(toNumber(result)).toBe(5);
Church multiplication

Expected Result: The product of Church numerals 2 and 3 should be 6.
Received Result: The result was 0 instead.
Location in code: tests/churchEncodings.test.ts:34:30
expect(toNumber(result)).toBe(6);
Church predecessor

Expected Result: The predecessor of Church numeral 3 should be 2.
Received Result: The result was 0 instead.
Location in code: tests/churchEncodings.test.ts:40:30
expect(toNumber(result)).toBe(2);
Church subtraction

Expected Result: The result of subtracting Church numeral 3 from 5 should be 2.
Received Result: The result was 0 instead.
Location in code: tests/churchEncodings.test.ts:46:30
expect(toNumber(result)).toBe(2);
Church booleans

Expected Result: The pretty-printed format of Church boolean True should be (λx.λy.x).
Received Result: The format was (λx.(λy.x)) instead.
Location in code: tests/churchEncodings.test.ts:53:42
expect(prettyPrint(interpret(True))).toBe('(λx.λy.x)');
Summary
Each test checks a specific aspect of Church encodings (numerals, addition, multiplication, predecessor, subtraction, and booleans). The comparisons in the tests are between expected and actual results.

For numerals, addition, multiplication, predecessor, and subtraction, the actual returned value is 0 instead of the expected numeric value.
For boolean representation, the output format is correct but not as expected due to slight differences in lambda expressions.
Next Steps
Check the functions interpret, numeral, toNumber, prettyPrint, and specific Church operations (add, mult, pred, sub) to identify the discrepancies. There is a consistent pattern of returning 0, suggesting an issue in the conversion or interpretation logic.
